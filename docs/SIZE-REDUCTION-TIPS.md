## Size Reduction Tips [Android]

- Following the below steps will help you to reduce the app size by over 60%.


1. First compress your asset files (png, jpg, gif), use any online free image compressor website to compress it.
2. Enable [hermes engine](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes)
3. Update you proguard rules -> `android/app/proguard-rules.pro`:
* Apply react-native: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/ReactAndroid/proguard-rules.pro
* Apply hermes: https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes
* Apply Zoom SDK:

```
-keep class  us.zoom.**{*;}
-keep class  com.zipow.**{*;}
-keep class  us.zipow.**{*;}
-keep class  org.webrtc.**{*;}
-keep class  us.google.protobuf.**{*;}
-keep class  com.google.crypto.tink.**{*;}
-keep class  androidx.security.crypto.**{*;}
```

* Make sure to also apply proguard rules for `react-native-*` libs that you use, e.g. for `react-native-svg` -> `-keep public class com.horcrux.svg.** {*;}`

4. Open `AndroidManifest.xml` and add inside `application` tag the following:

```xml
<application
 ...
 android:extractNativeLibs="true"
 ...
>
 ...
</application>
```
5. Go to `android/app/build.gradle` and enable:

```gradle
def enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture = true
def enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = true
```

> Proguard shrinks, optimizes and obfuscates Java code. It is able to optimize bytecode as well as detect and remove unused instructions. 

Now add the lines wherever I've mentioned `//ADD THIS LINE`:
```gradle
android {
    ...

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.zoom"
        minSdkVersion rootProject.ext.minSdkVersion
        targetSdkVersion rootProject.ext.targetSdkVersion
        versionCode 18
        resConfigs "en" //ADD THIS LINE 
        versionName "1.1.7"
        multiDexEnabled true
    }

    ...

    buildTypes {
        debug {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
        }
        release {
            // Caution! In production, you need to generate your own keystore file.
            // see https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android.
            shrinkResources true //ADD THIS LINE
            signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

## Fix Android App crash after bundle release to Play Store
If you're running `/gradlew bundleRelease` to release your app on Playstore then you need to disable progaurd
```js
def enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = false
```
& rest of the above settings will remain the same & once progaurd is disabled then rebuild the app and upload the bundle file to playstore again which will fix the crash.
 
> Google Play uses your app bundle to generate and serve optimized APKs for each device configuration, so only the code and resources that are needed for a specific device are downloaded to run your app. You no longer have to build, sign, and manage multiple APKs to optimize support for different devices, and users get smaller, more-optimized downloads.

See diff for the example app: https://github.com/mieszko4/react-native-zoom-us-test/pull/33

## Size Reduction Tips [iOS]

For iOS follow this: [ios-reduce-your-app-size-with-app-thinning](https://agostini.tech/2019/06/02/reduce-your-app-size-with-app-thinning/)

> Make sure to set `ENABLE_BITCODE = NO;` for both Debug and Release because bitcode is not supported by Zoom iOS SDK
